Brescia – Minimal Web Page
📌 Project Overview

This project is a minimal static web page about the city of Brescia, built using only HTML and CSS.
The focus of the project is simplicity, clean structure, and visual balance.

🎯 What this project is about

Creating a simple and minimal web page

Practicing semantic HTML structure

Styling layouts using only CSS

Working without JavaScript to focus on fundamentals

📚 What I learned

While working on this project, I learned and practiced:

How to structure a page using semantic HTML elements

How to organize CSS in a clear and readable way

How spacing, margins, and padding affect visual balance

How to use backgrounds and gradients to separate sections

How to think more in terms of design, not just code

This project helped me move from studying HTML and CSS to actually using them.

⚠️ What I struggled with / what I did wrong

During the project, I noticed some mistakes and limitations:

I relied too much on fixed values (px), which can cause layout issues on different screen sizes

I repeated similar CSS rules instead of reusing shared styles

Some class names could be simplified or made more consistent

These mistakes helped me understand what I need to improve in future projects.
