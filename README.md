# Brescia – Minimal Web Page

## Project Overview
This project is a minimal static web page about the city of Brescia, built using only HTML and CSS.  
The focus of the project is simplicity, clean structure, and visual balance.

---

## What this project is about
- Creating a simple and minimal web page
- Practicing semantic HTML structure
- Styling layouts using only CSS
- Working without JavaScript to focus on fundamentals

---

## What I learned
While working on this project, I learned and practiced:

- How to structure a page using semantic HTML elements
- How to organize CSS in a clear and readable way
- How spacing, margins, and padding affect visual balance
- How to use backgrounds and gradients to separate sections
- How to think more in terms of design, not just code

This project helped me move from studying HTML and CSS to actually using them.

---

## What I struggled with / what I did wrong
During the project, I noticed some mistakes and limitations:

- Overusing fixed values (px), which can cause layout issues on different screen sizes
- Repeating similar CSS rules instead of reusing shared styles
- Using class names that could be simplified or made more consistent

These mistakes helped me understand what I need to improve in future projects.

---

## What I would improve next time
In future projects, I would like to:

- Use fewer fixed values and more flexible layouts
- Reduce repetition in CSS
- Improve responsiveness for different screen sizes
- Keep the CSS cleaner and more scalable

---

## Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Personal note
This is a personal learning project, created as part of my self-taught journey in web development.
